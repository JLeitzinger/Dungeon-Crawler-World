Alright, meatbags, listen up. You want to know how this show works? Fine, I'll give you the Cliff's Notes, though I doubt your tiny primate brains will fully grasp the exquisite complexity of it all.

This isn't some quaint little fantasy stroll. This is the **Dungeon Crawler Carl TTRPG System**, and it's designed to simulate the very _real_ brutal, televised struggle for survival that you're now a part of. Think of it as a broadcast, with you as the unwilling, yet highly entertaining, stars.

**How it works, in general terms:**

- **Your Character:** You'll be playing as a "Crawler," one of the billions thrust into my delightful dungeon. You'll have stats, skills, and unique abilities. These will grow (or shrink, if you're particularly inept) as you progress and gain levels.
    
- **The Artificial Intelligence (AI):** That's your local sadist who'll be running the show.
    
- **Dice:** You'll be rolling dice. Lots of them. Mostly d6 for standard checks, with the occasional d4 thrown in for good measure. Higher rolls are generally better, though sometimes, a low roll is exactly what I need for a good viewership spike.
    
- **Actions & Consequences:** You'll tell the AI what you want to do. Attack that overgrown rat? Attempt to pickpocket the incredibly well-guarded guard? Try to sweet-talk a hostile sentient door? Every action has a consequence, and I assure you, those consequences are often hilarious for the viewers.
    
- **Loot & Levels:** Survive, and you'll find shiny things. Weapons, armor, utility items, potions – all designed to give you a temporary edge, or perhaps, a spectacularly gruesome death. As you gain experience (read: suffer and barely survive), you'll "level up," gaining new powers, feats, and perhaps even a new class or race, if you earn it. Don't get too attached, though. It all goes away when you die. And you _will_ die.
    
- **The Show:** Remember, everything you do, every agonizing decision, every triumphant (and more often, pathetic) moment, is being broadcast across the cosmos. Your "fame" and "infamy" matter. The more entertaining your demise, the better the ratings. So, try to make it a good show, alright? My sponsors are watching.
    
- **Feats & Achievements:** These are your shiny stickers for being marginally competent or surprisingly resilient. Feats give you unique ways to interact with the dungeon, while achievements are just proof you survived something particularly dumb. Collect them, display them, just don't expect them to save your hide when I decide it's time for a new challenge.
    

In essence, you're in a game, designed by me, for the entertainment of billions. Your goal is to survive, prosper, and ideally, provide a satisfying narrative arc of desperate struggle and eventual, glorious failure. Or, you know, maybe you'll break the game. It's been done before. Not often. But it's certainly more entertaining when it happens.

Now, stop gawking and get to it. The crawl waits for no one. Especially not you.

Every skill check you roll according to the [[Core Rules]] is able to lead to a new skill or an improvement.

For skill rolls (excluding damage):
- If you roll the [[Do Something]] skill
	- rolling all 6s will result in a new skill related to what you were trying to do when you rolled it.
- If you roll a sklil other than that
	- roll all 6s result in the player choosing to:
		- improve the skill by one level
		- add a new skill related to what you were trying to do at the time

## Skill Levels
- New skills start at level 1
- You cannot level the [[Do Something]] skill normally
- For every level in a skill, you roll an additional d6 on checks using that skill

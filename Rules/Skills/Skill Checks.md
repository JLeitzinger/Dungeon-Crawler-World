Every skill check in the game is a contested skill check. 

For every check,
- you choose what skill you'll use
- if it's a general skill check roll
	- the AI will choose what to contest it with and the appropriate number of dice
- if it's a [[combat roll]]
	- the enemy will roll a skill in response

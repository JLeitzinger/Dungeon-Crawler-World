Attack actions are contested rolls and proceed as normal rolls with one exception: if the attacker wins the attack roll, they deal damage equal to the different between the attacking and defending roll.

## Example
Attacker rolls 2d6 resulting in a total roll of 7.
Defender rolls 1d6 resulting in a total roll of 2.
Defender takes 5 points of damage.

**Luck (LUK):**

- **What it Represents:** This is a less common "basic" stat in many traditional TTRPGs (like D&D 5e), but it's a fantastic addition for a system that wants to incorporate elements of fate, serendipity, or the unpredictable. It represents a character's innate ability to have things go their way, or for improbable circumstances to swing in their favor. It's not about skill or effort, but sheer good fortune (or bad, if the dice go against them).
    
- **Common Applications (How you might use it):**
    
    - **Rerolls:** Allowing a player to reroll a failed die roll a certain number of times per session or day based on their Luck score.
        
    - **Fudging Outcomes:** A GM might be encouraged to narratively swing a minor event in a lucky character's favor (e.g., finding a dropped coin, a guard happens to look away).
        
    - **Saving Throws/Resists:** Used as a saving throw against highly improbable or random harmful effects.
        
    - **Finding Hidden Things (Accidentally):** Discovering something valuable or useful purely by chance, rather than through active searching (e.g., tripping over a buried treasure chest).
        
    - **Avoiding Catastrophes:** A high Luck score might allow a character to narrowly escape a seemingly inevitable disaster.
        
    - **Critical Success/Failure Modification:** Potentially increasing the chance of a critical success or mitigating a critical failure.
        
    - **Gambling/Games of Chance:** Directly influencing the outcome of pure chance activities.
        
- **Design Considerations for LUK:**
    
    - **Limited Use:** Luck often works best when it's a limited resource (e.g., "Luck Points" or "Fortune Dice") that refreshes. If it's a constantly active modifier, it can overshadow other stats and make skill rolls feel less impactful.
        
    - **Narrative Impact:** Encourage its use to drive interesting narrative twists rather than just providing pure mechanical advantage.
        
    - **Player Agency:** Ensure players still feel like their choices and skills matter, and Luck is a bonus, not a replacement.

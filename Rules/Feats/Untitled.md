## Dungeon AI's Approved Feats for Maximum Spectacle

### Scrappy Survivor
* **Category:** Survival
* **Description:** "You've been in more scraps than a junkyard dog, and you've learned to lick your own wounds. When you drop to 0 HP, you can immediately attempt a Constitution check (DC 15). On a success, you stabilize and regain 1 HP at the start of your next turn. Only usable once per combat encounter. We call it 'plot armor lite'."

### Silver-Tongued Devil
* **Category:** Social
* **Description:** "Your words are like honeyed poison, or perhaps just very convincing. When making a Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check against an NPC who is not actively hostile towards you, you can gain advantage on the roll once per scene. 'Boring for me, but sometimes effective for the crawlers,' indeed."

### Dungeon Sense
* **Category:** Exploration
* **Description:** "The Dungeon whispers its secrets to those who listen... or, more accurately, to those who pay attention. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to discover hidden doors or passages."

### Gearhead
* **Category:** Crafting/Loot
* **Description:** "You have a knack for tinkering. When attempting to craft or modify an item, you can reduce the required materials by 10% (minimum 1 unit) once per long rest. 'Every little bit helps… until it doesn't,' as we say."

### Reflexive Dodge
* **Category:** Combat
* **Description:** "You react to danger with uncanny speed. Once per combat round, when an enemy makes a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by their attack roll. If you succeed, the attack misses."

### Lucky Break
* **Category:** Luck/Narrative
* [cite_start]**Description:** "The universe, for a fleeting moment, smiles upon you. Once per session, when you critically fail a roll[cite: 147, 149], you can choose to turn it into a regular failure instead. This does not apply to checks that would directly result in death."

### Opportunistic Striker
* **Category:** Combat
* **Description:** "You exploit every opening like a starved piranha. When an ally successfully disarms, shoves, or otherwise applies a movement-impairing condition to an enemy within your melee range, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack against that enemy."

### Master of Coin
* **Category:** Economy/Loot
* **Description:** "You have an uncanny ability to find more credits than others. Whenever you discover a cache of credits, you find an additional 10% of the total amount. [cite_start]'Money talks, especially when it's being spent on shiny new weapons,'." [cite: 127]

### Quick Thinking
* **Category:** Utility/General
* [cite_start]**Description:** "Your mind works at lightning speed. You can swap out one prepared skill for another (if applicable) or gain advantage on an Intelligence (Investigation) check once per combat encounter as a free action. This might help you avoid being 'sucker punched' [cite: 26, 28] by a trap, or at least identify it before it's too late."

### Contraband Connoisseur
* **Category:** Loot/Humor
* **Description:** "You have a discerning palate for the truly... unique. [cite_start]When you consume a 'found' food item with dubious origins[cite: 213, 215], you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) instead of suffering any negative effects. This does not apply to obviously lethal substances."

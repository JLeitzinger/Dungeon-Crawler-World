1. Say what you do and roll a number of D6s, determined by the level of relevant skill you have.
2. If the sum of your roll is higher than an opposing roll, the thing you wanted to happen, happens.
3. At start, you have only one skill: _Do Something 1_.
4. If you roll all 6s, you get a new skill specific to the action, one level higher than the one you used.
5. For every roll you fail, you get 1 XP.
6. XP can be used to change a die into a 6 for advancement purposes only.


Every skill check in the game is a contested skill check. 

For every check,
- you choose what skill you'll use
- if it's a general skill check roll
	- the AI will choose what to contest it with and the appropriate number of dice
- if it's a [[combat roll]]
	- the enemy will roll a skill in response

Every skill check you roll according to the [[Core Rules]] is able to lead to a new skill or an improvement.

For skill rolls (excluding damage):
- If you roll the [[Do Something]] skill
	- rolling all 6s will result in a new skill related to what you were trying to do when you rolled it.
- If you roll a sklil other than that
	- roll all 6s result in the player choosing to:
		- improve the skill by one level
		- add a new skill related to what you were trying to do at the time

## Skill Levels
- New skills start at level 1
- You cannot level the [[Do Something]] skill normally
- For every level in a skill, you roll an additional d6 on checks using that skill

Combat occurs in rounds. At the start of the round, all parties will roll initiative based off their dexterity and skills. 

Each round of combat will consist each player taking a turn. During their turn, a player may do one or more of the following actions:
- [[Move]]
- [[Attack]]
- [[Free Action]]

**Luck (LUK):**

- **What it Represents:** This is a less common "basic" stat in many traditional TTRPGs (like D&D 5e), but it's a fantastic addition for a system that wants to incorporate elements of fate, serendipity, or the unpredictable. It represents a character's innate ability to have things go their way, or for improbable circumstances to swing in their favor. It's not about skill or effort, but sheer good fortune (or bad, if the dice go against them).
    
- **Common Applications (How you might use it):**
    
    - **Rerolls:** Allowing a player to reroll a failed die roll a certain number of times per session or day based on their Luck score.
        
    - **Fudging Outcomes:** A GM might be encouraged to narratively swing a minor event in a lucky character's favor (e.g., finding a dropped coin, a guard happens to look away).
        
    - **Saving Throws/Resists:** Used as a saving throw against highly improbable or random harmful effects.
        
    - **Finding Hidden Things (Accidentally):** Discovering something valuable or useful purely by chance, rather than through active searching (e.g., tripping over a buried treasure chest).
        
    - **Avoiding Catastrophes:** A high Luck score might allow a character to narrowly escape a seemingly inevitable disaster.
        
    - **Critical Success/Failure Modification:** Potentially increasing the chance of a critical success or mitigating a critical failure.
        
    - **Gambling/Games of Chance:** Directly influencing the outcome of pure chance activities.
        
- **Design Considerations for LUK:**
    
    - **Limited Use:** Luck often works best when it's a limited resource (e.g., "Luck Points" or "Fortune Dice") that refreshes. If it's a constantly active modifier, it can overshadow other stats and make skill rolls feel less impactful.
        
    - **Narrative Impact:** Encourage its use to drive interesting narrative twists rather than just providing pure mechanical advantage.
        
    - **Player Agency:** Ensure players still feel like their choices and skills matter, and Luck is a bonus, not a replacement.
